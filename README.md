# color-generator
simple color palette/hue generator! a quick mini project speedrun [![Athena Award Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Faward.athena.hackclub.com%2Fapi%2Fbadge)](https://award.athena.hackclub.com?utm_source=readme)


### features
- generate: generate a random color
- add colorbox: add up to 5 colorbox
- remove: remove most recent colorbox

### *why and how*
- i wanted to practice up a little more html and css, and also just do some project speedrunning :) 

### *learning process*
- this was mainly just because i wanted to practice a lot more with my coding speed. i am notoriously slow, and the time pressure of possibly pushing this literally to the LAST minute was a bit anxiety inducing but it definitely helped me lock in!
- also, i'd just come from suffering with python and wanted a chill project that wouldn't take literally 10 hours lol

### *image attributions*
- all images (background and plant sprites) were generated by Copilot

### *future features to be added*
- auto copy into clipboard
- color "locking"
- algorithm that makes sure all colors are unique and are cohesive in the color palette instead of 100% randomized
