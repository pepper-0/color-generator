# color-generator
... a simple color palette/hue generator! aka a quick mini project speedrun [![Athena Award Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Faward.athena.hackclub.com%2Fapi%2Fbadge)](https://award.athena.hackclub.com?utm_source=readme)

check it out [here <3](https://pepper-0.github.io/color-generator/)

### *features*
- generate!: generate a (set of) random color(s)
- add another color: add up to 5 colorboxes that display on the site concurrently
    - you will be notified if you exceed 5 colorboxes.
- remove a color: remove most recently added colorbox

### *why and how*
- made with: 
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
- i just finished a FAT python project that i had to learn more or less all at once, as i don't typically use python. as a super quick break, i thought i'd whip up a simple and easy project as a refresher on HTML/CSS/Javascript!
- and also, this is an Athena Award project! thought I'd make an extra one for the fun of it, but it also was a huge speedrun challenge. (thank you phtallo for extending the deadline so i can make this readme not sound incoherent 🙏)

### *learning process*
- while the whole "making-an-extra-project-starting-on-the-deadline-day-for-athena" was an impulsive decision, it also gave me a chance to practice my coding speed. i am notoriously slow at coding in general, and the time pressure of this definitely pushed me to try to optimize my code.
- also, i have a tendency to write a lot of unecessary CSS because i don't really know what i'm doing sometimes LOL. so while i just finished my project in terms of functionality, i'm also going back and learning the proper syntax for rulesets (like border, instead of border-style, border-width, border-color etc) in order not to make my CSS 192834 lines long.
- in the future i would want to try to redo this site using tailwind. i originally tried installing it but i think my computer and vscode hates me, so it didn't work and I had to scrap that.

### *future features to be added*
- auto copy into clipboard
- color "locking"
- algorithm that makes sure all colors are unique and are cohesive in the color palette instead of 100% randomized
- rewritten in tailwind!
- interactive grid background 
- fun cursor
